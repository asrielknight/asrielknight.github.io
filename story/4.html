                Your name is MAX. Your bedroom is pretty much barren with the exception of your BED and MER PC. You have a very limited quantity of HYPERFIXATIONS. You've recently been getting back into the CYBERPUNK FRANCHISE and HOMESTUCK. You like to program DISCORD BOTS but you SUCK AT IT. You're a well-established fan of HORROR MOVIES, although you'll watch anything that your mind wanders to. You also play a lot of VIDEO GAMES.
