                Listen, you know it's messy. You just don't have the time nor the attention span to pick everything up and put them away in your various STORAGE CONTAINERS lying around. You'll get around to it. Someday.
                <br /><br />
                No, you won't, and you know it.
                <br /><br />
                Among the items on your floor are: ONE (1) MARSHADOW PLUSH, ONE (1) BOTTLE OF MELATONIN, ONE (1) BOTTLE OF ADVIL, ONE (1) NINTENDO SWITCH, SEVERAL (~) CABLES, and SEVERAL (~) UNREAD BOOKS.
                <br /><br />
                These items will probably never be useful. You decide to pick up the PLUSH.
