                <b>You open DISCORD, your CHAT CLIENT OF CHOICE. The side of your screen is littered with the various SERVERS created by your FRIENDS, who naturally are filling up your entire FRIENDS LIST. Your FRIENDS LIST would be more full but you had a MOMENT OF CLARITY a couple months ago and decided to clear it out.<br /><br />Each SERVER you are in is filed into FOLDERS, and those FOLDERS are named and utilised based on your LEVEL OF ACTIVITY or NEED for each one. The ones you are most active in are inside of the first FOLDER, which is aptly named "ACTIVE". The rest don't need to be mentioned.<br /><br />Looks like the first SERVER in your ACTIVE FOLDER is the one that is active. This one is your first (and personal favourite) FRIEND SERVER, and you always feel an intense amount of NOSTALGIA looking through it. It has a small number of ACTIVE USERS, but these USERS are your best friends, so you don't mind.</b>
